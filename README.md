# Burp Suite Project Documentation

This README.md file documents the steps I took during my Burp Suite project. The project involved setting up a proxy, launching a target, performing spidering, vulnerability scanning, brute force attacks, and exploiting a known SQL injection vulnerability using Burp Suite.

## Setup Proxy

1. Open Burp Suite and navigate to the "Proxy" tab.
2. Configure your browser to use Burp Suite as a proxy.
   - Set the proxy settings to:
     - Proxy Type: HTTP
     - IP: [Your Burp Suite IP]
     - Port: [Your Burp Suite Port]

## Launch Target

1. Identify the target website for testing.
2. Launch the target website in your browser.
3. Observe the requests captured in Burp Suite.

## Fast & Hybrid Spidering

1. Navigate to the "Target" tab in Burp Suite.
2. Use the "Spider" tool for fast and hybrid spidering (crawling) of the web application.

## Vulnerability Scan

1. Use the "Scanner" tool in Burp Suite for vulnerability scanning.
2. Analyze the scan results and identify potential vulnerabilities.

## Brute Force Attack

1. Navigate to the "Engagement Tools" in Burp Suite.
2. Use the "Intruder" tool for brute force attacks.
3. Configure payload sets and run the attack.

## Exploit SQL Injection

1. Identify a target page vulnerable to SQL injection.
2. Use the "SQLi" tool in Burp Suite to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability.
